# DayOneRandom
Day One doesn't have a random entry button (yet!), but this web page will allow you 
to go to any random entry that you've put into it. Requires a little work each time 
you write a entry, but it's worth it!

To get your entry IDs:
1. Right-click on a entry
2. Select "Copy Entry URL"

I like to put a comment with the date of the entry next to each entry ID so I know 
what it is. This step is up to you; but if you have thousands of entries it could help
you find things later. Maybe you'd like to put keywords here instead; up to you.
