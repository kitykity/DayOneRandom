# DayOneRandom
Day One doesn't have a random entry button (yet!), but this web page will allow you 
to go to any random entry that you've put into it. Requires a little work each time 
you write a entry, but it's worth it!

To get your entry IDs:
1. Right-click on a entry
2. Select "Copy Entry URL"

I like to put a comment with the date of the entry next to each entry ID so I know 
what it is. This step is up to you; but if you have thousands of entries it could help
you find things later. Maybe you'd like to put keywords here instead; up to you.

## A more high tech solution...
If you export all your Day One entries in .json format, you can pull out all the lines that have "uuid" in them, and then there are all your post uuids! I'll put a separate short script here that will make all the HTML links for you if you have a file that's just a big long list of uuid's.
